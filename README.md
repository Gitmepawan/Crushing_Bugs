# Troubleshooting JavaScript
Crushing programming bugs
# Assignment Description
Use the in-class build files (the Puzzle Drag and Drop) and fix the bugs that were discovered in
class. This is a research assignment - solve the problems outlined in the brief.
Create new branches (named appropriately) and update the functionality to improve
the game UX.
# Assignment Requirements
In its current state, our puzzle game has at least a couple of bugs. You can drag and drop more
than one puzzle piece into a drop zone - this shouldn’t happen. There should only be one piece
in one drop zone at a time.
The second bug is the problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a
new puzzle. Those should be removed / reparented back to the drag zone as well, so that the
player has a fresh board to drop onto.
Solve these two problems. You can use the original drop function to solve the first problem, and
another function for the second. Try experimenting with calling one function from another - you
might not need to add any event handling to solve these issues, just extend the functionality.
Don’t overthink it! When you’re starting down a programming path, the trend is to
overcomplicate the issues. Resist that - break it down into simple steps BEFORE you try writing
code, and then do some research.
